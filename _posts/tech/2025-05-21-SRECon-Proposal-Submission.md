## I Am Now An SRE

After starting the team and helping lead the development of Spring Health’s in-house provider availability system (a story that deserves its own post), I officially transitioned into an SRE role in mid-2024. My mission: to make Observability Driven Development the default. It’s an ambitious culture shift and one that leans more on the socio than the technical. That makes it a challenge, but also a rich learning opportunity (all problems are people problems at the end of the day, right???).

As part of this move, I’ve been leading our internal effort to adopt SLOs. This is actually our fourth attempt. Since I already used my learning budget on [Local First Conf](https://www.localfirstconf.com/), I needed a different path to get to [SRECon Emea 2025](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon25emea). So I’m going the speaker route and leveraging this story of _our journey to SLO Readiness_ as my way to get there.

Today I officially submitted my talk proposal! While I very well might not be accepted, it's the first step in the journey towards becoming a speaker and really a participant in not just SRE at Spring, but the entire SRE community. Excited!

While `Hope is Not a Strategy` may be _the_ SLO saying, hopefully I follow up soon with good news... wish me luck!

**Will post the details of the submission here later following the review period.**
