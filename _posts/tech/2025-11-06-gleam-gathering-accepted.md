Super excited to announce that I was selected as a speaker for the first ever Gleam programming language conference! The conference will take place at the [Origin Workspace](https://originworkspace.co.uk/) in Bristol on February 21, 2026. Check out the [conference website](https://gleamgathering.com/).

Without giving too much away, I'll be discussing my experience leveraging Gleam to develop the [caffeine language](https://caffeine-lang.run/) compiler for internal reliability tooling at [Spring Health](https://www.springhealth.com/).


Ever since joining the Rust community at their [third annual conference](https://2018.rustconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon in 2018, I've been seeking that early programming language community experience and the opportunities that come with it. While my formal PL background is limited to brief research, independent studies, podcast binging, and hobby language hacking, I look forward to the day when I can find a way to make working on a compiler with a bunch of awesome, fun, like-minded people my day job.
