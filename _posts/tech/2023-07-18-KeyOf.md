As I explore the possible solution space for designing a type for the [Pyret programming language](https://pyret.org/), I've spent some time grappling with the concept of structural type compatibility. Specifically, I am interested in TypeScript's type system and the `keyof` operator. This blog post focuses on summarizing what I've learned thus far. 
If these concepts interest you, stay tuned. I plan to continue exploring these ideas and ultimately aim to answer the question: *can we leverage this concept within Pyret?*

## Type compatibility

We'll use the term `type compatible` throughout this post, so let's take a moment to formally define it. As best summed up by [Nominative and Structural Typing](http://wiki.c2.com/?NominativeAndStructuralTyping), type systems _must_ be able to answer two type compatibility questions:

1. **equivalence:** *given two type expressions T1 and T2, are T1 and T2 equivalent? In other words, are all objects of type T2 valid objects of type T1, and vice versa? Commonly written as T1 == T2*
2. **subtype:** *given two type expressions T1 and T2, is T1 a subtype of T2? In other words, are all objects of type T1 also objects of type T2? Commonly written as T1 <= T2*

Generally, there are two main approaches to answering these questions: structural and nominative.

**Structurally typed:** type compatibility is determined by the structure of the types

**Nominally typed:** type compatibility is determined by the name of the types

Consider the following example.

```
foo {
    bar: () => string
}

baz {
    bar: () => string
}
```

In a nominally typed language, `foo != bar`, however in a structurally typed language, `foo == bar`.

**What about Duck Typing?** Duck typing is dynamic type compatibility at runtime; both structural and nomative typing are static.

**Which is better?** Of course, it depends: one of the main pros of nominal typing is differentiation between two types of the same structure, i.e. MeasurementInFeet and MeasurementInMeters. Structural typing is advantageous for its flexibility.

While we're comparing structural and nominal type systems, note _hybrid_ systems (I don't believe this is a technical term) exist.

> At a base level, C++ is nominatively typed--two classes with different names are not considered equivalent; and subtyping must be explicitly declared (via inheritance). However, the template system uses structural typing--any type can be an argument to any template; and the compiler won't complain unless a particular instantiation of a template is incompatible with its declaration. (See LatentTypesSmell for more on this). -- [Nominal and Structural Typing](http://wiki.c2.com/?NominativeAndStructuralTyping)

## Structural Typing

I have much more experience with nominally typed systems: C#, Python, Java, Rust (albeit a bit fuzzy), Haskell (which is _mostly nominal_), etc. Thus, I will focus here on structurally type languages.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a structurally typed typed programming language that transpiles to Javascript allowing for engineers to gradually introduce types to an existing, dynamic, duck typed, Javascript codebase and/or leverage the expansive JavaScript ecosystem with an additional layer of safety.

Unless you're already familiar with TypeScript's type system, I'd recommend opening up a [TS Playground online editor](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) in another screen as you read along. 

In a structurally typed language, since we care about structure, not about name, an analogous operator for `.class` or `.type` is `keyof` (hand waavy, hand waavy) where `keyof` returns a concatenated collection of object properties.

```typescript
type Point = { x: number; y: number };

// "x" | "y"
type P = keyof Point;
```

TypeScript also has a limited `typeOf` operator as well ([see more on limitations here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/typeof-types.html#limitations)).

```typescript
type Point = { x: number; y: number };

// typeof pt = Point
const pt: Point = { x: 10, y: 11 }
```

And supports subtyping and interface implementation as so:

```typescript
// interface definition: in TypeScript, describes shape of data. Interfaces can be extended and implemented but we cannot
// create a new one by intersecting two together (that is a type).
interface foo {
    isTasty: bool
}

// type definition: in TypeScript, a definition of a data type. Types are aliases for structures. These can be combined, but cannot
// be duplicated or extended.
type Animal = {
    makesNoise: bool
}
```

### Keyof Examples

So in what ways is `keyof` useful? It may not be immediately obvious... it certainly wasn't for me!

1. accessing an object in a "safe" way via generic constraints 

```typescript
interface Food {
    isTasty: boolean;
}

let pizza = { isTasty: true }

function isMyAThing(food: Food, attribute: keyof Food): boolean {
    return food[attribute];
}

isMyAThing(pizza, "isTasty")
isMyAThing(pizza, "isHealthy") // will fail
```

Here `isMyAThing` does two interesting things: (a) indexes properties of a type (b) constrains input of attribute to just being valid properties of `Food`.

2. map over properties of an existing type

```typescript
type Boolify<T> = {
    [K in keyof T]: boolean
} 

interface SomethingUseful {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

type SomethingLessUseful = Boolify<SomethingUseful>;

let notHelpful: SomethingLessUseful = { name: true, age: false };
```

Here `Boolify` maps all properties of the generic `T` to `boolean`s,

3. in conjunction with utility types (i.e. Record, Pick, etc.) which manipulate the type (since its structural typing, that means manipulating the underlying properties)

Consider `Record`: which *constructs an object type whose property keys are Keys and whose property values are Type. This utility can be used to map the properties of a type to another type* more formally `Record<Keys, Type>`.

```typescript
type Qualities = {
    isTasty: boolean;
    isHealthy: boolean;
    calories: number;
}

interface Info {
    value: string
}

type Food = Record<keyof Qualities, Info>;

const asparagus: Food = {
    isTasty: { value: "sometimes" },
    isHealthy: { value: "yes!" },
    calories: { value: "idk" }
}
```

4. create new types

```typescript
type Food = {
    isTasty: boolean;
}

type Decoration = {
    isPretty: boolean;
}

type DecorativeFood = Food & Decoration;

const weddingCake: DecorativeFood = {
    isTasty: true,
    isPretty: true,
}

type DecorationOrFood = Food | Decoration;

const bacon: DecorationOrFood = {
    isTasty: true
};
const painting: DecorationOrFood =  {
    isPretty: true
}

type DecorationOrFoodDescription = keyof Food | keyof Decoration;

const bacon: DecorationOrFood = 'isTasty'
const painting: DecorationOrFoodDescription =  'isPretty'
```
