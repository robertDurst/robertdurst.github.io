By no means am I a newcomer to the world of open source:
* I have contributed to numerous repos across the [Stellar](https://stellar.org/foundation) ecosphere including [`stellar-core`](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/graphs/contributors)
* I implemented the `prompt io` method for [pyret lang](https://pyret.org/) - ([PR](https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/pull/1688))
* some friends and I launched an ice cream store on the Bitcoin Lightning Network - first of its kind ([link](https://github.com/BlockAndJerrys/block-and-jerrys))
* I even contributed a couple PRs to `wasm-bindgen` [many years ago](https://github.com/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ArobertDurst+is%3Aclosed)

However, _this first_ is extra special because it's for the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/) community, a language I'm super excited about and [will even be speaking about in a few months]((https://gleamgathering.com/)).

[Here is my PR - "[Typo/Bug] Fix Link Reference in Hello Gleam Post"](https://github.com/gleam-lang/website/pull/577).

Funny enough, my first foray into Stellar core was also [a small documentation fix](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/pull/1564) 😁.

Excited for the future and to continue to dive in deeper and deeper to the Gleam ecosystem, not just as a user but also as a contributor.
