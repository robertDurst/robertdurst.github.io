## A Spoiler üëÄ

### Talk Short Description

Scaling a site-reliability culture from the ground up at a hyper-growth, resource-constrained startup is a uniquely challenging endeavor: plenty of playbooks exist, yet every startup‚Äôs socio-technical reality is its own puzzle. And while ‚Äúreliability is the most important feature‚Äù rings true, tight deadlines and shifting priorities often sideline proactive reliability initiatives. Thus, since these cycles are a precious commodity, ensuring their success is paramount.

By retracing our SLO adoption journey, highlighting failures, missteps, and near wins en route to our eventual breakthrough, we uncover an effective litmus test for gauging readiness, or recognizing when a team isn‚Äôt quite there yet.

Today, this readiness framework guides how we assess the timing of reliability investments at Spring Health. It also serves as a practical tool for teams in fast-growing engineering orgs still early in their reliability journey, especially those navigating similar constraints.

## En Route to Becoming an Active Member of the Global SRE Community

In preparation for becoming a more active participant in the SRE community, working on my _personal brand_.

**Socials (short form)**:
  * [Linkedin (peep the new headshot)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertdurst)
  * [Twitter](https://x.com/grumpy_sre)


**Blogging (medium form)**:

Futhermore, while I have done some blogging here in the past:
* [Spaced Out Thoughts Development Foundation '24](https://spaced-out-thoughts-development-foundation.org/)
* [Spring Health '22](https://medium.com/spring-health-engineering/the-birth-of-the-performance-lab-at-spring-health-76b768c9c967)
* [Docusign '21](https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/my-experience-why-defensive-coding-matters)

I will be working to publish more, especially on the things I learn and build at _Spring Health_ and from my side independent research work at [Zen SRE Studio](https://www.zen.sre.studio/).

**Publications (long form)**: 

I setup my [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0009-0008-7180-2648) which will be used for my talk for the conference. Also linked my contribution (not authorship) from some undergrad work in 2020 ([Nessie: Automatically Testing JavaScript APIs with Asynchronous Callbacks](https://www.software-lab.org/publications/icse2022_Nessie.pdf)).
