Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## About Me

I am a Software Engineer on the Platform team at Spring Health. I graduated remotely from Colby College in 2020 with a **computer science major** and **mathematics minor**. In the past, I've taken on a few interesting programming endeavors including creating my own programming language -- the slightly less than functional [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc) -- and attempting to sell [Ice Cream for Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt). When afk, you can find me cruising the Wasatch in my wrangler, skiing some of the finest powder in the world, or launching a paddleboard with my wife somewhere tropical.
