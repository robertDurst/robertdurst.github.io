Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## About Me

I am a Site Reliability Engineer on the Platform team at Spring Health. On the side, I run [Brickell Research](https://brickellresearch.org), an independent research lab exploring the intersection of system reliability and programming languages. Our main project is [Caffeine](https://caffeine-lang.run), which we've really enjoyed building in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)! I graduated from Colby College in 2020 with a **computer science major** and **mathematics minor**. Along the way I've had a few interesting programming endeavors including creating my own programming language - the slightly less than functional [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc) - and attempting to sell [Ice Cream for Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt). When afk, you can find me cruising the Wasatch in my wrangler, skiing some of the finest powder in the world, or launching a paddleboard with my wife somewhere tropical.
