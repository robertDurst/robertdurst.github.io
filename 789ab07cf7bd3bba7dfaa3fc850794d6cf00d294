          "text": "Nice post! It's concise and personal. Here's my feedback:\n\n**Typos/Grammar:**\n- Line 10: \"numerours\" → \"numerous\"\n- Line 12: \"it's kind\" → \"its kind\" (possessive, not contraction)\n- Line 15: \"a world in which I am super excited about\" is grammatically awkward. Consider: \"a community I'm super excited about\" or just \"which I'm super excited about\"\n\n**Content observations:**\n- The parallel between your first Stellar contribution and first Gleam contribution both being documentation fixes is a nice touch\n- The structure works well: establishes open source credibility → highlights this contribution as special → personal reflection\n- The teaser about your upcoming talk at Gleam Gathering is a good inclusion\n\n**Minor suggestions:**\n- The phrase \"the world of Gleam\" appears twice (lines 15 and 21). You could vary it slightly in one instance (e.g., \"the Gleam ecosystem\" or just \"Gleam\")\n- Consider briefly mentioning what the contribution actually was (even just \"a small docs fix\" inline) for readers who don't click the image/link\n\nOverall it reads well as a short, celebratory post. The personal connection and enthusiasm come through.",
